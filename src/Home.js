        <p>Hi I'm Asghar. I am a very hard working individual. My motto in life is that hard work can over come any obsticles.
                               Programming has been my passion and now I am fullfilling my dream as I face the mystic world of programming.
                              With my enthusiasm and devotion to programming, I believe that I can take my creativity to soaring heights.</p>
